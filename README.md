# ATTENDANCE-MANAGEMENT

## Overview of the Project:

Academic Attendance Manager is a console-based Python application that helps students track their subject-wise attendance, visualize their attendance status with charts, and predict how many classes they need to attend (or can skip) to meet the minimum required percentage. With an easy-to-use menu system, students can quickly see their attendance summary and take control of their schedule.

## Features:

- Add attendance for single or multiple subjects.
- View detailed reports for any subject, showing SAFE/RISK status.
- Predict classes to attend or skip for each subject to reach the minimum requirement (default 75%).
- Generate pie charts for individual subjects.
- Generate bar charts showing attendance percentage for all subjects.
- Menu-driven interface; easy navigation.

## Technologies/Tools Used:

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib (for charting)

## Steps to Install & Run the Project

## Instructions for Testing
Start the program and try all menu options.
Enter sample data for single and multiple subjects.
Check that reports, predictions, and charts display correctly.
Test edge cases like 0 classes, skipping all remaining classes, etc.
Verify the program loops through submenus as expected until you choose to exit.
