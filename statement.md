# ATTENDANCE MANAGER

## **Problem Statement:**

Students often struggle to keep track of their attendance across multiple subjects and meet the minimum requirement of 75%. Calculating how many classes they can skip or must attend to maintain eligibility is confusing and tedious without a helpful tool.

## **Scope of the Project:**

This project provides a console-based solution for students to manage and visualize their academic attendance. Users can enter details for individual subjects or all subjects together, view attendance reports with SAFE/RISK status, generate visual charts, and receive actionable predictions about their attendance needs.

## **Target Users:**

College and university students who want a self-help tool to track their own attendance across all subjects and maintain required percentages.

## **High-Level Features:**

- Input and manage attendance data for single or multiple subjects.

- View subject-wise attendance reports and pie charts.

- Predict classes to attend or skip to reach minimum requirements.

- View overall attendance in tabular and bar chart format.

- Simple menu-driven navigation with instant feedback and visualizations.
